# AIPS Code Challenge 

## Requirements:

1. _This_ repo: `git clone https://github.com/alphastrata/interviews/aips_go`.
2. Golang >= 1.18
3. A working internet connection (for `go mod` to work)
4. Some cmdline/terminal proficiency.
5. A browser, if you're wanting to read documentation generated by godoc.

- `NOTE:You may need to restart your machine/relogin to your shell (depending on your os). `

## Building:

- `go mod tidy`
- `go build main.go`

## Usage:

- The program reads its data from the `assets/` directory, it requires a file called `data.txt`, see below for more details. If your data conforms to the same formatting etc you can easily append or override the `data.txt` file entirely as suits your needs.
- `./main` (after you've built it) or,
- `go run main.go` (if you want to build and run)

## Testing:

From your terminal of choice:

- `go test -v` (you can omit the `-v` flag if you're only wanting to see failing tests)

TODO:
## Docs:

- `godoc -http:=6060` then in your browser hit up `http://localhost:6060/pkg/`

### Data:
Data must be format exactly:
```
2021-12-05T15:30:00 15
2021-12-08T18:00:00 33
```
Notes:
*`yyyy-mm- ddThh:mm:ss n` where `n` denotes the number of cars counted, positive values only.
* data need not be contiguous

### Benchmarking:
